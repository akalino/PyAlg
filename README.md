# PyAlg

Monte Carlo simulation to solve the percolation problem: is there a connected path from the top of a
system of sites to the bottom?

These scripts also explore using the python threading library to distribute the computation to
multiple threads, thus speeding up the computation when running a larger number of simulations.
